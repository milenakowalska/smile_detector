# Smile Detection â€“ Deep Learning Project
## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This is a learning project that demonstrates how to build and train a deep neural network to detect smiles in facial images.
The dataset contains 32Ã—32 pixel images, each labeled as smiling or not smiling.

## ðŸ§  Model

A deep neural network (DNN) was implemented using Keras.
The network was trained on the image dataset and achieved accuracy close to 100%, successfully distinguishing smiling faces from non-smiling ones.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset

Input: Grayscale images of size 32Ã—32 pixels

Labels: Binary (smile / no smile)

The dataset used in this project was provided by Holczer Balazs as part of his Udemy course "Machine Learning and Deep Learning Bootcamp in Python".

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

Training accuracy: ~100%

Validation accuracy: ~100%

The model demonstrates strong learning performance on the provided dataset.
